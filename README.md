# The 8 week SQL Challenge!

This challenge is an initiative from Danny Ma to support all data professionals do some exercises with SQL and for people that are starting on their SQL learning journey. I thought this is a very nice initiative it and why not giving it a try.

Let us unlock the mysteries of JOINs, dance with aggregates, and summon the arcane powers of filtering and sorting. Fear not, dear beginners, for this enchanting quest is a gateway to knowledge and growth!

Credits to [@DataWithDanny](https://github.com/DataWithDanny) for this initiative.

## [Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner](https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Week%201%20-%20Danny's%20Diner)

Danny, an ardent lover of Japanese cuisine, embarked on a daring journey at the start of 2021. He decided to open a small, charming restaurant named "Danny's Diner," specializing in his three top favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.

Danny's Diner, after a few months of operation, requires your expertise to help them keep the business viable. The diner has managed to collect some basic data during their initial months of operation, yet they are unsure of how to utilize this information effectively to bolster their business operations.

The goal here is for Danny to utilize this data to understand more about his clientele - their visit patterns, their total expenditure, and their preferred items on the menu. Acquiring such insights will enable Danny to personalize the experience for his loyal customers more effectively.

Based on these insights, Danny intends to make an informed decision about whether or not to enhance the existing customer loyalty program. He also needs assistance in creating straightforward datasets so that his team can easily review the data without the need to use SQL.

For privacy reasons, Danny has given a sample of his overall customer data. Nevertheless, he is hopeful that this limited data will be sufficient for you to formulate functional SQL queries to assist him in finding the answers to his questions!

## [Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner](https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Week%202%20-%20Pizza%20Runner)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
