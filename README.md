# The 8 week SQL Challenge!

This challenge is an initiative from Danny Ma to support all data professionals do some exercises with SQL and for people that are starting on their SQL learning journey. I thought this is a very nice initiative it and why not giving it a try.

Let us unlock the mysteries of JOINs, dance with aggregates, and summon the arcane powers of filtering and sorting. Fear not, dear beginners, for this enchanting quest is a gateway to knowledge and growth!

Credits to [@DataWithDanny](https://github.com/DataWithDanny) for this initiative.

Propose a [PR](https://https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/pulls) wherever you see fit please :)

## [Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner](https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Week%201%20-%20Danny's%20Diner)
<p align="center">
<img src="Week 1 - Danny's Diner/logo-week1.png" align="center" width="300" height="300" >

Danny, an ardent lover of Japanese cuisine, embarked on a daring journey at the start of 2021. He decided to open a small, charming restaurant named "Danny's Diner," specializing in his three top favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.

Danny's Diner, after a few months of operation, requires your expertise to help them keep the business viable. The diner has managed to collect some basic data during their initial months of operation, yet they are unsure of how to utilize this information effectively to bolster their business operations.

The goal here is for Danny to utilize this data to understand more about his clientele - their visit patterns, their total expenditure, and their preferred items on the menu. Acquiring such insights will enable Danny to personalize the experience for his loyal customers more effectively.

Based on these insights, Danny intends to make an informed decision about whether or not to enhance the existing customer loyalty program. He also needs assistance in creating straightforward datasets so that his team can easily review the data without the need to use SQL.

For privacy reasons, Danny has given a sample of his overall customer data. Nevertheless, he is hopeful that this limited data will be sufficient for you to formulate functional SQL queries to assist him in finding the answers to his questions!

## [Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner](https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Week%202%20-%20Pizza%20Runner)

<p align="center">
<img src="Week 2 - Pizza Runner/logo-week2.png" align="center" width="300" height="300" >

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## [Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi](https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Week%203%20-%20Foodie-Fi)

<p align="center">

Danny identified a gap in the market and wanted to establish a new streaming service focused solely on food-related content, similar to Netflix but dedicated to cooking shows. In 2020, he assembled a team of talented individuals to launch his startup called Foodie-Fi.

They introduced monthly and annual subscription options, providing customers with unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world. Danny's approach to building Foodie-Fi was data-driven, ensuring that all future investment decisions and new features were based on data. This case study explores the utilization of subscription-style digital data to address crucial business questions.

## [Case Study #4 - Data Bank](https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Week%204%20-%20Data%20Bank)

<p align="center">
<img src="Week 4 - Data Bank/logo-week4.png" align="center" width="300" height="300" >

A fresh concept in the financial sector called Neo-Banks is emerging, characterized by fully digital, new-age banks that have no physical branches.

Danny, inspired by this development, envisions a fusion of these modern banks, cryptocurrency, and the realm of data. Thus, he launches a revolutionary initiative known as Data Bank!

Functioning much like any other online bank, Data Bank isn't merely a platform for banking transactions. It's also home to the globe's most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers receive cloud storage space, which is determined by the amount of money held in their accounts. However, there are some intriguing twists to this business model, which is where the Data Bank team needs your expertise!

The management at Data Bank aims to expand their overall customer base and needs assistance in monitoring the data storage requirements of their customers.

This case study centers on computing key metrics, fostering growth, and enabling the company to intelligently analyze their data. This will facilitate more accurate forecasting and strategic planning for their future progress!

## [Case Study #5 - Data Mart](https://github.com/KonstantinosTsoumas/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Week%204%20-%20Data%20Bank)

<p align="center">
<img src="Week 5 - Data Mart/logo-week5.png" align="center" width="300" height="300" >

Data Mart is Danny’s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyse his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it’s separate business areas.

The key business question he wants you to help him answer are the following:

What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?

Clique Bait isn't your typical online seafood retailer - it's the brainchild of founder and CEO, Danny, who leverages his experience from working in digital data analytics, aiming to bring new insights into the seafood sector!

 For this case study, the task is to help Danny's ambition by assessing his dataset. Your objective is to conjure inventive methods to determine the funnel dropout rates for the Clique Bait online store.
