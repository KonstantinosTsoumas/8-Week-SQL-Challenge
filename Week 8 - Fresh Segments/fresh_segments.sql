-- The [index_value] is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.
-- Average composition can be calculated by dividing the 'composition' column by the [index_value] column rounded to 2 decimal places.

-- 1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
