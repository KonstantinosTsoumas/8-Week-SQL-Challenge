-- The [index_value] is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.

-- 5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?
-- If we pay attention to the top interest names, it's evident that there are services related to travelling.
-- This lead us to believe that we're dealing with highly seasonal matters and that Fresh Segments is relying on this.
